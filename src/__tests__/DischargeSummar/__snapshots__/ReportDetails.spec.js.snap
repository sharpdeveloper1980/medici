CT abdomen:
1) Thickened wall in long segment of sigmoid colon, consistent
with diverticulitis, unchanged. There is a small amount of
interlooped free fluid in the pelvis, not amenable to drainage.
2) Pelvic fluid collection, of uncertain origin, that was
aspirated from [**10-17**] and shown to be not contaminated, and
unchanged.

TTE: Moderate aortic regurgitation and minimal aortic stenosis
but no discrete vegetation seen (does not exclude). Regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2161-7-23**], left
ventricular systolic function is now depressed (40%). The
severity of aortic regurgitation is similar.

CXR: Right jugular dialysis catheter is in right atrium. PICC
line is in SVC, partly obscured by the dialysis catheter. Linear
atelectases are present in both lower zones. No pleural
effusion. Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine
and in the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Surgical clips are
present in the right upper quadrant status post cholecystectomy.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old women with ESRD on HD who
presents with fever to 103, chills, and tachycardia to 103 with
possible line infection.
.
1.  Sepsis:  The patient was initially sent to the intensive
care unit under the sepsis protocol. She was started on
vancomycin for skin flora and unasyn for Group D enterococcus
(VRE) sensitive to amp (previous infections over last year). Her
blood cultures drawn at [**Location (un) 4265**] grew out oxacillin resistant coag
negative staph. Her urine cultures were without grown.  A CXR
was obtained and was without signs of pneumonia. Once she was
stabilized, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was sent to the floor where her
tunneled catheter was removed. The tip was sent for culture but
did not grow any organisms.
Access was an issue as 3 attempts in ED failed, including one
with US. Instead a PICC was placed and eventually, after she was
free of bacteria for &gt; 48 hours, a new tunnel line was placed.

Despite placement of a new line and clean surveillance cultures,
Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fevers. She spiked through her
vancomycin which was always re-dosed when her daily levels fell
below 15. An [**Known lastname 1676**] CT was obtained, revealing a 7 cm mass,
consistent with an abscess, above the bladder. Considering that
she had been recently hospitalized with a diverticulitis and
peritonitis, it seemed urgent to intervene on this "abscess". It
was evacuated under IR guidance but no organisms appeared on
gram stain and nothing grew on culture. It became apparent that
this was most likely a fluid collection from the patient's
peritoneal dialysis. The patient continued to spike fevers so a
work up was commenced that included a chest x ray, a TTE (since
she has a murmur, although old) and more blood and urine
cultures. All these studies were negative. As the patient
continued to spike fevers and had one bout of emesis, another
[**Known lastname 1676**] CT was obtained. It showed diverticulitis and so a 14
day course of flagyl and levofloxacin was started. It was
decided that a general surgery consult would be obtained once
she was an outpatient in order to faciliate resection of the
affected length of bowel. At discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
instructed to continue her levo, flagyl, and vanco to complete a
14 day course of each one. Her vanco levels were to be followed
and redosed at HD.
.
2.  ESRD:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] usually dialyzes on Tues, Thurs, Sat but
here she was switched to Monday, Wednesday and Saturday under
the guidance of the renal team. Her electrolytes were followed
and repleted very consevatively as needed. It was noted that her
phosphate calcium product was quite high, so her sevelamer was
titrate up. She was also placed on a renal diet. The patient
reports making urine, however not an adequate measure of
perfusion due to ESRD. She hopes to continue her peritoneal
dialysis and felt were upset at having to start HD. The method
of dialysis was to be further addressed as an outpatient with
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], after her diverticular disease was resolved.

.
3.  DMII:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is usually on oral hypoglycemics. These
oral agents were held due to their long half life and instead
she was covered with RISS with QID finger sticks. Her home
regimen of glipizide was restarted at discharge. While in house,
she was on a controlled carbohydrate diet.
.
4.  HTN:  Ms.[**Known lastname 14301**] home regimen includes metoprolol,
moexipril and diltiazem. Initially the metoprolol was continued
and the diltiazem and moexipril were held since the patient is
currently not hypertensive. Before discharge, she was restarted
on moexepril but not diltiazem. She was also started on an
aspirin and atorvastatin before discharge.
.
5.  Afib:  The patient is on coumadin as outpatient for
anticoagulation.  This was hold anticoagulation in case she
required urgent line placement.  Her rate was easily controlled
with beta blocker. Before discharge, her coumadin was restarted,
but very cautiously as it interacts with her 2 antibiotics for
her diverticulitis, flagyl and levofloxacin. She was advised to
have her INR followed carefully and her warfarin titrated as
needed for an INR [**1-17**].
.
6.  CAD by hx (fixed perfusion defect) but clean coronaries by
cath:  The patient was continued on metoprolol but given her
current anticoagulation status and possible need for urgent line
placement the aspirin was held.  Her ACE inhibitor and statin
were initially held and re-started later in her course.

Medications on Admission:
1.  Metoprolol 150mg TID
2.  Diltiazem 360mg once daily
3.  Glipizide 10mg [**Hospital1 **]

Please note, you should have your INR and vancomycin level
checked at HD. Your medications need to be adjusted accordingly,
eg. you should receive 1000 mg of vancomycin for a level less
than 15 and you should increase your warfarin if the INR is less
than 2 and decrease it if the level is greater than 3. Your
warfarin level will need to be checked 2-3 times per week while
you are on the metronidazole and levofloxacin because these
antibiotics will increase your INR.
